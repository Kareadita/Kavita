How to Install
1. Unzip the archive to a directory that is writable. If on windows, do not place in Program Files.
2. (Linux only) Chmod and Chown so Kavita can write to the directory you placed in.
3. Run Kavita executable.
4. Open localhost:5000 and setup your account and libraries in the UI.

If updating, copy everything but the config/ directory over. Restart Kavita.
