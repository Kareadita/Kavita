## Setup
The easiest way to get started is to visit our Wiki which has up-to-date information on a variety of
install methods and platforms.
[https://wiki.kavitareader.com/en/install](https://wiki.kavitareader.com/en/install)

**Note: Kavita is under heavy development and is being updated all the time, so the tag for bleeding edge builds is `:nightly`. The `:latest` tag will be the latest stable release.**

## Notice
Kavita is being actively developed and should be considered beta software until the 1.0 release.
Kavita may be subject to changes in how the platform functions as it is being built out toward the
