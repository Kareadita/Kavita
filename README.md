## Demo
If you want to try out Kavita, we have a demo up:
[https://demo.kavitareader.com/](https://demo.kavitareader.com/)
```
Username: demouser
Password: Demouser64
```

## Setup
### Non-Docker
- Unzip the archive for your target OS
- Place in a directory that is writable. If on windows, do not place in Program Files
- Linux users must ensure the directory & kavita.db is writable by Kavita (might require starting server once) 
- Run Kavita
- If you are updating, do not copy appsettings.json from the new version over. It will override your TokenKey and you will have to reauthenticate on your devices.

### Docker
Running your Kavita server in docker is super easy! Barely an inconvenience. You can run it with this command: 

```
docker run --name kavita -p 5000:5000 \
-v /your/manga/directory:/manga \
-v /kavita/data/directory:/kavita/data \
--restart unless-stopped \
-d kizaing/kavita:latest
```

You can also run it via the docker-compose file:

```
version: '3.9'
services:
    kavita:
        image: kizaing/kavita:latest
        volumes:
            - ./manga:/manga
            - ./data:/kavita/data
        ports:
            - "5000:5000"
        restart: unless-stopped
```

**Note: Kavita is under heavy development and is being updated all the time, so the tag for current builds is `:nightly`. The `:latest` tag will be the latest stable release. There is also the `:alpine` tag if you want a smaller image, but it is only available for x64 systems.**
