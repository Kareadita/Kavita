Oswald Variable Font
====================

This download contains Oswald as both a variable font and static fonts.

Oswald is a variable font with this axis:
  wght

This means all the styles are contained in a single file:
  Oswald-VariableFont_wght.ttf

If your app fully supports variable fonts, you can now pick intermediate styles
that arenâ€™t available as static fonts. Not all apps support variable fonts, and
in those cases you can use the static font files for Oswald:
  static/Oswald-ExtraLight.ttf
  static/Oswald-Light.ttf
  static/Oswald-Regular.ttf
  static/Oswald-Medium.ttf
  static/Oswald-SemiBold.ttf
  static/Oswald-Bold.ttf

Get started
-----------

1. Install the font files you want to use

2. Use your app's font picker to view the font family and all the
available styles
